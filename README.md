# Python Package Showcase
A compilation of scripts that each describe a package of Python that I have worked with. Nothing fancy! This repository holds a compilation of scripts each with pertaining to a single Python package. Some of these packages are super well known, and anyone familiar with Python will be familiar with them, but others are a bit less heard of.

## Naming convention
Each script will be named "p_PACKAGE.py" where PACKAGE is the name of the package as you would import it (e.g. "pandas" is used in "p_pandas.py"). The only exception are Python's own builtins, which are in "p_builtins.py".

## Disclaimer
This repository is mostly for my own personal use, so don't expect much code readibility. Sometimes I forget a) how to use a package, b) that a particular package that I could use even exists. So I scan these from time to time, to remind me of a package that can be useful if I ever find myself stuck.
